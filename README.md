# cis480_project
This is the new project repo.

I added a .gitignore from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore
This should take care of all of the ide config files and whatnot.
Please let someone know in the slack room if .gitignore needs to be altered

Additionally everyone should create a branch with their name and issue pull requests instead of merging directly into this branch.
